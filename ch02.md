# Lammps Syntax and Source Code Hierarchy

In this chapter, we will outline the LAMMPS input script structure and connect script  commands with the source code operating in the background. The source code repository  is introduced, followed by the class hierarchy that is responsible for setting up the  simulation framework and parsing commands, and it culminates in a brief overview   of several top-level classes.

We will cover the following topics:

- Introducing the structure of a typical LAMMPS input script

- Introducing the repository of source code files

- Reviewing the source code hierarchy

- Functions of selected top-level classes

The end goal of this chapter is to explain how the source code lays out the simulation  foundations, which will help you better understand the process of modifying or extending LAMMPS.

## Technical requirements
To execute the instructions in this chapter, we only need a text editor (for example,  Notepad++, Gedit)

## Introducing the LAMMPS input script structure
LAMMPS offers built-in features to construct MD simulations using its own scripting  syntax. An inventory of LAMMPS script syntax is available on the LAMMPS website  (www.lammps.sandia.gov). The input script is executed line by line from beginning  to end. A typical input script consists of the following parts: 

- Initialization Settings

- System Definitions

- Simulation Settings

- Simulation Execution

A sample input script may look like the one shown here:

An input script such as this sets up an MD simulation by specifying the simulation box size and boundaries, creating atoms, defining the pair potentials between atoms, applying  a thermostat, and finally executing the simulation. The command lines starting with `pair` define pair potentials, and the lines starting with `fix` perform a multitude of operations on the system, including thermostat and time integration. A large number of MD features are implemented via the `pair` and `fix` commands, both of which will be discussed in detail later in *Chapter 5, Understanding Pair Styles, and Chapter 7, Understanding Fixes*.

At each line, the command script is scanned by the LAMMPS executable and the  corresponding source code is executed. The source codes controlling the entire operation  are introduced in the next section.

## Introducing the source code repository
After downloading and unzipping LAMMPS (visit https://lammps.sandia.gov/ doc/Install_tarball.html for instructions), the source code can be accessed from  the src folder, shown as follows:

<img src=fig2_2.png>
</div>

The source files are mostly arranged in pairs of C++ and header files with the extensions  .cpp and .h, respectively, which together are responsible for performing a given role in  the simulation.

When a LAMMPS executable is compiled, the source files are built into it, along with any  optional package. The folders titled in all uppercase letters in *Figure 2.2* contain optional  packages that can be built into the LAMMPS executable if specified. Once compiled  successfully, the executable is capable of recognizing LAMMPS input script commands and calling the appropriate source code files that have been installed.

When a LAMMPS script is executed, the top-level classes in the source code first  instantiate LAMMPS and set up the simulation by allocating memory, parsing input  script lines, partitioning processors, instantiating an integrating class, and constructing  neighbor lists. It allows the rest of the input script to be executed, including pair and fix  commands, and to finish by printing screen outputs. The top-level classes and the source  code hierarchy are discussed in the next section.

## Reviewing the source code hierarchy
The topmost-level class in the source code hierarchy is lammps.cpp (and lammps.h),  which initiates LAMMPS by accommodating an instance of LAMMPS. In doing so,  lammps.cpp allocates fundamental classes that are accessible throughout the code,   as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig2_3.png>
</div>

This instantiation is invoked by the main.cpp file, which also conveys the input script to  this instance of LAMMPS for subsequent execution, as shown in the following screenshot: 

<div align=center>
<img src=fig2_4.png>
</div>

The rest of the simulation setup is performed by several other top-level classes, some of  which are described here in brief:

- `memory.cpp`: Creates and destroys multi-dimensional arrays 
- `error.cpp`: Prints errors and warning messages and aborts simulation 
- `universe.cpp`: Creates and initializes partitions to divide and assign simulation domains to different cores 
- `input.cpp`: Parses and executes commands in LAMMPS input script 
- `finish.cpp`: Prints output to screen at the completion of a simulation
- `atom.cpp` and `atom_vec.cpp`: Store and allocate arrays that contain atomic information, such as position, force, and molecule index
- `update.cpp`: Instantiates an integrator; contains physical constants in various units and provides access to the timestep
- `neighbor.cpp`, `neigh_list.cpp`, and `neigh_request.cpp`: Construct neighbor lists and store lists for all atoms; allow particular categories of neighbor lists to be invoked when required
- `group.cpp`: Assigns atoms to groups, and controls and computes properties of these groups
- `force.cpp`: Sets up the platform to calculate bonded and non-bonded forces by creating and validating pair, bond, angle, dihedral, and many more classes
- `modify.cpp`: Sets up the platform to apply fixes and computes by creating and validating lists of fix and compute classes
- `output.cpp`: Sets up classes and memory to write outputs to file or display on screen

In addition, there are parent classes, known as `styles`, that hold a large number of  child classes (for example, `fix style`, `pair style`, and `compute style`). These parent classes and  their child classes are most relevant when implementing MD features, especially in the  simulation settings and simulation execution stages in a LAMMPS script where these  classes are called.

**Important Note**:
For more information on the source code repository and hierarchy, please refer to https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/.

While the top-level classes generally do not need to be modified for end user purposes,  the child style classes can be readily modified to implement custom MD features. These  classes will be discussed in detail in the following chapters.


## Summary
The LAMMPS source code hierarchy has been presented in this chapter to illustrate the  roles performed by various top-level classes in setting up the simulation groundwork.  Furthermore, we mentioned three styles that are more pertinent when custom features  need to be incorporated into LAMMPS, and these styles will be explored in depth.

The next chapter will guide you through the structure of the source code files and the  stages of execution that the source code undergoes within each iteration of the timestep.

# Section 2:
Understanding  the Source Code  Structure

The LAMMPS source code controls the flow of information and performs required  calculations during a MD simulation run. Given the vast extent of the source code,   how can we understand the functions of the various components? 

In this section, you will learn how to understand the various components of the source  code that run in the background when LAMMPS commands are executed. Emphasis  is placed on the internal mechanisms that function during the execution of pair styles,  computes, and fixes.
