# 6 Understanding Computes

In the previous chapter, we explored some of the pair styles implemented in LAMMPS.

In this chapter, we will analyze some computes and gain a similar understanding of their  source code. Computes return various quantities from the simulation run, and learning  to understand the code that is responsible for the associated calculations is essential if we  wish to write new computes for custom purposes.

We will cover the following topics in this chapter:

- Reviewing the general structure of computes

- Reviewing the compute KE class

- Reviewing the compute group/group class

- Reviewing the compute RDF class

- Reviewing the compute heat flux class

By the end of this chapter, you will understand the inner mechanism of selected computes and be able to make further modifications to the LAMMPS source code.

## Technical requirements

To execute the instructions in this chapter, you just need a text editor (for example, **Notepad++** or **Gedit**).

## Reviewing the general structure of computes
In this section, we will briefly cover some of the methods most commonly used in  compute child classes.

Similar to pair styles, individual computes inherit from the parent Compute class  described by `compute.cpp` and `compute.h` classes. These parent classes read the first  three arguments (compute ID, group ID, and compute style) from the LAMMPS input  script. The following screenshot shows some of the variables and arrays from `compute.h`  that are inherited:

</div>

Figure 6.1 – Code snippet from compute.h

The child compute classes may contain one or more of the following methods:

- The init() method sets up the class and performs preliminary validation checks.

- The init_list() method sets up neighbor lists or pointers to neighboring lists.

- The compute_scalar() method computes a scalar quantity generally used as an output

- The compute_vector() method computes a vector quantity generally used as an output.

**Important Note:**
Given the broad range of applications for which computes are used, many other  methods can be implemented in individual computes.

Next, we will review a few select computes to illustrate the code working behind these  computes.

## Reviewing the compute KE class
In this section, we'll study the methods implemented in the compute `KE` class, which calculates *kinetic* energy of a group of atoms.

The **kinetic energy (KE)** of an atom of mass m and linear velocity $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ is calculated using the following equation:

$$KE=\frac{1}{2}m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)$$

The `compute_ke.cpp` class can be used to calculate the kinetic energy of a specified group of atoms. In a LAMMPS input script, the corresponding syntax is as follows:

```
compute COMPUTE_ID GROUP_ID ke
```

As you can see, the `COMPUTE_ID` parameter is the unique ID of the compute defined,  while the GROUP_ID parameter is the ID of the group of atoms that the compute acts  on. This is described in detail in the LAMMPS manual (https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_ke.html). First, we will look at the constructor method,  `ComputeKE::ComputeKE()`, of this class.

### ComputeKE::ComputeKE()
This constructor method inherits from the `Compute` parent class (*line 26*) and checks the number of arguments, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_2.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.2 – Code snippet from compute_ke.cpp showing the constructor

For this compute, exactly three arguments (compute ID, group ID, and compute style) are  permitted (*line 28*), which are all read in `compute.cpp`. Since KE is returned as a scalar quantity, the `scalar_flag` and `extscalar` variables are activated in *lines 30* and *31*.

Next, we will look at the init() method.

**ComputeKE::init()**
The `init()` method serves to initialize this compute `KE` class and defines a conversion  factor (`pfactor`) that converts into the correct unit of energy, as described in *Chapter 4, Accessing Information by Variables, Arrays, and Methods*. This method is shown in the  following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_3.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.3 – Code snippet from compute_ke.cpp showing the init() method

The bulk of the KE computation is performed by the `compute_scalar()` method, discussed next.

### ComputeKE::compute_scalar()
This method computes the KE of every atom in the group specified and finds the sum over all atoms, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_4.jpg>
</div>
Figure 6.4 – Code snippet from compute_ke.cpp showing the compute_scalar() method

As you can see, *line 56* checks if the per-atom mass (`rmass`) is activated, which would  assign individual masses to individual atoms. The code loops over all the atoms in the core  (*line 57*), identifies the atoms belonging to the specified group (*line 58*), and calculates and  appends the KE of each atom using its rmass value and its velocity (*line 59*).

If the mass of each atom is defined according to its atom type, the same procedure is  followed (*lines 60* to *65*), with the exception of using the mass of the atom type in the KE calculation (*line 63*).

The `ke` variable stores the combined KE of all the atoms in the core, and the sum of KE  over all the cores is computed using the `MPI_Allreduce()` method (*line 67*), which  accepts the following arguments:

- `&ke`: This is the variable that passes the local sum in the core as input.

- `&scalar`: This is the variable that stores the global output from all cores combined.

- `1`: This is the size of the input and output arrays.

- `MPI_DOUBLE`: This represents the data type of the input and output quantities.

- `MPI_SUM`: This is the operation type (that is, summation) to be executed.

- `world`: This represents the cores over which the operation is performed.

The **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** is an attribute of the compiler (not exclusive to 
LAMMPS) that allows information exchange between cores. More information about 
MPI is available in *Appendix C, Getting Familiar with MPI*. The relevant header file 
can be imported into `compute_ke.cpp` with the following library:

```
#include <mpi.h>
```

Apart from finding the sum, the `MPI_Allreduce()` method allows a number of  reduction operations, including finding maximum, minimum, and product of quantities,  to be calculated over multiple cores.

Finally, the global sum of KE obtained from the `MPI_Allreduce()` method and  stored as the `scalar` variable (which has been inherited from compute.h, as seen in  *Figure 6.1*) is converted into the proper units by multiplying it by the conversion factor,  pfactor (*line 68*), and returning it (*line 69*).

In this section, we analyzed a relatively short compute style that returns a scalar quantity.

In the next section, we will look at a compute that calculates the interaction energies and  forces between two groups of atoms.

## Reviewing the compute group/group class

In this section, we will analyze a more elaborate compute that employs a larger number of 
methods.

The interaction energy and the forces between two groups of atoms can be obtained using  `compute group/group` and are implemented by the `compute_group_group. cpp` and `compute_group_group.h` classes. The LAMMPS input script command to  implement this compute is as follows:

```
compute COMPUTE_ID G1 group/group G2 
```

The `COMPUTE_ID` parameter is the unique ID of the compute, while the `G1` and `G2`  parameters are the IDs of the groups of atoms that the compute acts on (see manual:  https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_group_group.html). The  optional parameter keywords listed in the manual can be entered after these parameters  to specify other options, such as the interaction type (*pair potential or electrostatic*) and  molecule ID (same or different). The constructor method accommodates these optional  parameters, as we'll see in the following sections.

### ComputeGroupGroup::ComputeGroupGroup()
This constructor takes in a minimum of four arguments (*line 50*), of which three are read  by `compute.cpp`. The scalar and vector output types are specified (*lines 52* to *55*) to  accommodate energy and force outputs, respectively.

*Lines 57* to *59* read the fourth argument from the input script command and store it as a  `group2` string to represent the second group of atoms. Then, the corresponding group  ID is located as a `jgroup` variable (*line 61*), and an error is generated if the group does  not exist (*lines 62* to *63*). On *line 64*, the bitwise representation of the group is generated  as `jgroupbit`, which is used to identify atoms belonging to this group (please see  Appendix B, Debugging Programs, for more information about bitwise representations). 

The following screenshot shows the `ComputeGroupGroup()` constructor:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_5.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.5 – Code snippet from compute_group_group.cpp showing the constructor method

The default settings of this compute with regards to the optional keywords, as described in  the LAMMPS manual (that is, `pair = yes`, `kspace = no`, `boundary = yes`, and  `molecule = off`), are facilitated by flag values 0 or 1 in *lines 66* to *69*. Any optional  keyword is accommodated by *lines 71* to *105*, which loop over all the arguments to look  for permitted keywords and adjust the flag values as required.

Once the parameters have been parsed, the `init()` method performs some error checks and requests a neighbor list, if required.

### ComputeGroupGroup::init() and init_list()
The `init()` method checks whether pair styles and electrostatic interactions exist  between the groups specified (if they are enabled) and also initiates the corresponding  pair and kspace objects (*lines 122* to *144*). A neighbor list is requested (*lines 167* to *172*) if  pair style interaction needs to be calculated, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_6.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.6 – Code snippet from compute_group_group.cpp showing the init() method

The `init_list()` method provides access to pointers to the neighbor list using the  list pointer defined in `compute_group_group.h`, as shown in the following  screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_7.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.7 – Code snippet from compute_group_group.cpp showing the init_list() method

Having created access to a neighbor list, we will now look at the `pair_contribution()` method, which calculates the pairwise energy and forces.

### ComputeGroupGroup::pair_contribution()
This method is invoked if the pair flag is enabled and the pair potential between the  two groups needs to be calculated. First, the neighbor list is built (*lines 230* to *235*), and  then the code loops over all the atoms, `i`, belonging to the first group (`G1`) and their  neighbors, `j`.

Only the neighbors, `j`, belonging to the second group (`G2`) are selected (*lines 261* to *271*).  In accordance with the molecule keyword, the molecule IDs are checked in *lines 275* to  *281* to determine if each atom, `j`, belongs to the same molecule as atom `i`. The following  screenshot shows the computations of energy and force:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_8.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.8 – Code snippet from compute_group_group.cpp showing the pair_contribution() method

The energy and force of pair potential interaction between `i` and `j` is computed by  invoking the `single()` method in the corresponding pair style (*line 290*) and tallied  into the first element of the 1D array, one (*line 296*). The force components acting on `i`  are tallied in the next three elements of the `one` array (`one[1]`, `one[2]`, `one[3]`) in  *lines 297* to *306*. The array elements are summed over all cores (*line 324*), as follows:

```
MPI_Allreduce(one,all,4,MPI_DOUBLE,MPI_SUM,world);
```

The sum of energies is tallied in the `scalar` variable (*line 325*) and updated if the  electrostatic energies need to be incorporated in the `kspace_contribution()`  method (*line 346* and *line 363*). The sum of each force component is stored in the  1D `vector` array (*line 326*). Both `scalar` and `vector` are inherited from the  `compute.h` class.

The calculations performed by this method are invoked by the `compute_scalar()` and  `compute_vector()` methods, as required by the compute.

### ComputeGroupGroup::compute_scalar() and compute_vector()
The `compute_scalar()` method invokes the `pair_contribution()` and  `kspace_contribution()` methods to obtain the pair and electrostatic energies.  The `compute_vector()` method invokes the same methods to obtain the force  components. Both these methods are depicted in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_9.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.9 – Code snippet from compute_group_group.cpp showing the compute_scalar() and compute_vector() methods

In this section, we analyzed some of the methods that constitute `compute group/group` and return the energy and force of interaction between two groups of atoms.

In the next section, we'll look at `compute RDF`.

## Reviewing the compute RDF class
In this section, we will look at the source code for the `compute_rdf.cpp` and 
`compute_rdf.h` classes, which govern the compute RDF class.

The `compute RDF` class calculates the **radial distribution function (RDF)** of a group of atoms and returns the normalized numbers of neighbors, sorted into bins that have a uniform radial width ($\Delta {r}$ ) and that extend from zero to a specified cutoff distance. The output is returned as a 1D array that can be used to plot an RDF histogram. For each atom, the value of its RDF ($g(r)$) at a distance, r, is calculated by taking the ratio of the number of its neighboring atoms ($N$), which are located in the distance range $(r, r + \Delta {r})$ from the atom, to the number of atoms that would have been located in the same range if the atom distribution were uniform.

To derive this function, we must divide the periphery space of a central atom into shells of width dr that each occupy a volume of $dV_{shell}$ :

$$dn(r)=\rho g(r)dV_{shell}$$

From the preceding equation, $dn(r)$ represents the number of neighbors in a shell with radius $r$ and width $dr$, while $dV_{shell}$ is the volume of this shell, which in 3D is approximated by the following equation:

$$dV_{shell}=\frac{4}{3}\pi (r+dr)^3-\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\simeq 4\pi r^2dr$$

The quantity, $\rho$ , represents the system's atom density, which is calculated by the following equation:

$$\rho=\frac{Number\  of\  Neighboring\  Atoms\  in\  Simulation\  Box}{Volume\  of\  Simulation\  Box}$$

Hence, the RDF can be solved using the following equation:

$$g(r)=\frac{dn(r)}{4\pi r^2dr\rho}$$

Altogether, when a discrete bin width, $\Delta {r}$ is implemented, the RDF in 3D converts into the following:

$$g(r)=\frac{N(r, r+\Delta {r}}{4\pi r^2(\Delta {r})\sigma}=\frac{N(r, r+ \Delta {r})}{\frac{4\pi}{3}[(r+\Delta {r})^3-r^3]\rho}$$

The system, $g(r)$, is calculated by averaging individual $g(r)$ values over all the atoms in the system.

In 2D, the equation for $g(r)$ changes in the denominator:

$$g(r)=\frac{N(r, r+\Delta {r}}{2\pi r^2(\Delta {r})\sigma}=\frac{N(r, r+ \Delta {r})}{\pi [(r+\Delta {r})^3-r^3]\rho}$$

The system density, $\sigma$ , is calculated over the unit area:

$$\sigma =\frac{number\ of\ neighboring\ atoms\ in\ simulation\ box}{area\  of\  simulation\  box}$$

The LAMMPS inputs script command for implementing the compute RDF is as follows:

```
compute COMPUTE_ID GROUP rdf NBIN 
```

As you can see, the `COMPUTE_ID` parameter is the unique ID of the compute, while the  `GROUP` parameter is the ID of the group of atoms that the compute acts on (see manual:  https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_rdf.html). The `NBIN` integer  is the number of bins for which the $g(r)$ will be calculated. The optional keywords listed  in the manual can be entered after these parameters to specify atom type pairs (multiple  times) and a user-defined cutoff. The constructor method accommodates these optional  parameters, as we will see in the following sections.

### ComputeRDF::ComputeRDF()
The following screenshot shows the `ComputeRDF()` constructor method:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_10.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.10 – Code snippet from compute_rdf.cpp showing the constructor method

As you can see, the method accepts a minimum of four input parameters (*line 47*) and  activates an array flag to generate output (*line 49* to *50*). The number of bins is read in  *line 52* and stored as an integer, *nbin*.

To keep count of any additional arguments that are entered, the `nargpair` variable  must be introduced and reset to zero at the fourth argument (*line 64*). While looping over  the additional parameters (*lines 66* to *74*), any user-defined cutoff is identified using the  `strcmp()` method (*line 67*), which locates the `cutoff` keyword. The corresponding  numeric value following this keyword is read by the `force->numeric()` method (*line  69*). If no cutoff is provided, the longest pairwise cutoff defined in the system is used by  default (see the `init()` method).

The `npairs` variable is introduced in `compute_rdf.h` (*line 38*) to keep count of the  number of atom type pairs specified by the optional input parameters. In the constructor,  `npairs` is given a default value of `1` if no additional atom type pairs are entered (*line  78*). For any additional atom type pairs that are entered, the `npairs` variable equals the  number of pairs entered (*line 81*), while ensuring that an even number of atom types are  entered (*line 80*).

*Lines 84* and *85* define the size of the 2D global array (inherited from `compute.h`),  which possesses `nbin` number of rows and (`1+2*npairs`) columns to accommodate the  bin coordinates, $g(r)$ values, and the coordination numbers (described in the LAMMPS  manual) to deliver the output.

*Lines 88* to *89* initialize two new structures – a 3D array called `rdfpair` and a 2D array  called `nrdpair`. Any optional atom type pairs entered are parsed in *lines 98* to *107*.  In order to deal with wildcard atom type pairs entered in the input script, the `force- >bounds` method is used (*lines 101* to *102*), which can assign the lower and upper bounds  of atom types to the `ilo`, `ihi`, `jlo`, and `jhi` variables. For example, if there are five atom  types in the system and the pair types that have been entered is “* 4”, then we get `ilo=1`,  `ihi=4`, and `jlo=jhi=4`. 

In *lines 109* to *120*, the parsed atom type pairs are stored in the `nrdfpair` and `rdfpair`  arrays, which we declared earlier in lines 88 to 89. The 2D `nrdfpair` array records  the number of atom type pairs for which the RDF should be calculated, while the 3D  rdfpair array adds an extra dimension to indicate the index of the atom type pair. The  array itself records the `npair` value that corresponds to the atom type pair that's been  parsed. These two structures help prevent repeated calculations and save computation  time in the `compute_array()` method.

In the rest of the constructor method, memory is allocated (*lines 122* to *124*) for the 2D  global array (`array`) to generate the final output and the 2D `hist` and `histall` arrays  to accommodate the $g(r)$ values until the output is ready. These arrays are deallocated  in the destructor method (*lines 144* to *146*), along with any other arrays defined in  `compute_rdf.h`.

Next, we will look at the `init()` and `init_list()` methods.

### ComputeRDF::init() and init_list()
The `init()` method calculates the cutoff and the skin width while determining the bin  width from this cutoff, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_11.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.11 – Code snippet from compute_rdf.cpp showing the init() method

As you can see, *lines 162* to *180* calculate the cutoff that can be applied to ghost atoms  when a user-defined cutoff is provided, before performing a check to reduce the frequency  of rebuilding neighbor lists (*lines 175* to *177*). Then, the bin width, `delr`, is obtained  by dividing the cutoff by `nbin`. If a user-defined cutoff is not provided (*line 181*), the  cutoff is set to the maximum cutoff distance defined among all implemented pair styles  (accessed by `force->pair->cutforce`). The reciprocal bin width (`delrinv`) is  calculated in *line 183* to reduce any computational overhead associated with the division  operator afterward.

In *lines 187* to *188*, the first column of `array` is populated with the midpoints of the bins.  The neighbor list is requested at the end of this method (*lines 205* to *212*). The `init_list()` method provides access to pointers to the neighbor list in the same way as what  happens in the `compute group/group` class.

### ComputeRDF::init_norm()
The `init_norm()` method calculates the normalizing factor used in the $g(r)$ calculation.  Here, the number of atoms of each type present in the group is determined and used  to calculate the normalizing factor when computing the RDF. The following screenshot  shows this method:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_12.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.12 – Code snippet from compute_rdf.cpp showing the init_norm() method

The number of atoms (of each type) in the group is counted (*lines 235* to *237*). In *lines 243*  to *252*, the number of atoms (of each type) used to calculate the RDF is determined. If the  default number of atom type pairs is used (`npairs = 1`), then the index, `m = 0`, and all  atom types in the system are used in the RDF calculation.

Index `i` (*line 245*) and index `j` (*line 247*) loop over all the atom types to count the  number of atoms to be used in the calculation before storing these as variables; that  is, `icount[m]` and `jcount[m]` (see *lines 95* to *107* in the constructor method).  The number of duplicate atoms that appear in both groups are also counted as  `duplicates[m]`. If optional atom types are entered, then the range of indices, `i` and `j`,  cover the specified atom types only, and `icount[m]` and `jcount[m]` equal the number  of atoms of these types only.

The `icount`, `jcount`, and `duplicates` arrays are updated to include atoms from  all cores by the `MPI_Allreduce()` methods in *lines 254* to *261*. The array elements  are used in the `compute_array()` method to calculate and normalize the RDF, as  explained in the next section.

### ComputeRDF::compute_array()
The `compute_array()` method calculates the RDF and the coordination number of  the specified group and atom types. First, the neighbor list is employed to loop over all the  atoms in the core and calculate the distance, r, between every central atom and each of  its neighbors (*line 347*). The bin index (`ibin`) for this r is determined by rounding to the  largest integer that's less than the product of r and the reciprocal bin width (`delrinv`) in  *line 348*, which is as follows:

```
ibin = static_cast<int> (r*delrinv);
```

The corresponding bin in the 2D `hist` array is incremented by `1` to tally this neighbor 
(*line 353*):

```
hist[m][ibin] += 1.0; 
```

In the `hist` array, the first index (`m`) identifies the atom type pair for which the neighbor  is counted, while the second index (`ibin`) represents the bin into which the neighbor is  tallied. The hist arrays are summed over all the cores (*line 366*) and the results are stored  in the 2D `histall` array.

This way, the histall array contains the number of atoms in each bin summed over all the central atoms in the entire simulation box; that is, $\sum_{i=1} ^{icount[m]} {N_i(r, r+\Delta {r})}$ , sorted into separate rows corresponding to the atom type pair specified. If no additional atom type pair is provided, `histall` consists of a single row corresponding to all atom types.

The final part of the RDF calculation involves proper normalization and is shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_13.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.13 – Code snippet from compute_rdf.cpp showing the compute_array() method


As you can see, $g(r)$ for a 3D system is calculated in *lines 375* to *394*. The quantity, $\frac{4\pi}{3V}$ , is  defined in *line 376* as the constant variable, where V is the volume of the simulation  box. Then, for each atom type pair (`m`), a normalization factor (`normfac`) is calculated  in *lines 379* to *380* by subtracting the number of duplicates (`duplicate[m]`) from the  number of neighbors counted (`jcount[m]`) for all bins.

The code then loops over each bin (*lines 382* to *393*) and calculates the following quantities:

- `rlower`: The lower bound of the bin ($r$)

- `rupper`: The upper bound of the bin ( $r+\Delta {r}$)

- `vfrac`: The volume fraction occupied by the bin $\frac{4\pi}{3V}[(r+\Delta {r})^3-r^2]$

The $g(r)$ of the system is then calculated in line 387, like so:

$$g(r)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{icount[m]}{N_i(r,r+\Delta{r})}}{\frac{4\pi}{3V}[(r+\Delta {r})^3-r^3]*normfac*icount[m]}$$

The $\frac{normfac}{V}$ ratio represents the density ($\rho$) of the neighboring atoms, while the $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{icount[m]}{N_i(r, r+\Delta {r})}}{icount[m]}$ represents the average, $N(r, r+\Delta {r})$, over all participating atoms.

Therefore, this expression represents the average $g(r)$ of the system in 3D:

$$g(r)=\frac{N_{avg}(r, r+\Delta {r})}{\frac{4\pi}{3}[(r+\Delta {r})^3-r^3]\rho}$$

The $g(r)$ can also be calculated for a 2D system in *lines 396* to *416*. Now, the `constant` variable (*line 397*) is defined as $\frac{\pi}{A}$, where A is the area of the simulation box, and subsequently the `vfrac` variable (*line 406*) equals $\frac{\pi}{A}[(r+\Delta {r})^2-r^2]$. Here, the $g(r)$ of the system is as follows (*line 408*):

$$g(r)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{icount[m]}{N_i(r, r+\Delta {r})}}{\frac{\pi}{A}[(r+\Delta {r})^2-r^2]*normfac*iconut[m]}$$

Similar to the 3D case, the $\frac{normfac}{A}$ ratio represents the density ($\sigma$) of the neighboring atoms, and the expression for the average $g(r)$ of the system in 2D is obtained by using the following equation:

$$g(r)=\frac{N_{avg}(r,r+\Delta {r})}{\pi[(r+\Delta {r})^2-r^2]\sigma}$$

For both the 3D and the 2D systems, the average $g(r)$ of the system is calculated for different values of $r$ by looping over every bin. The corresponding coordination numbers are calculated (*lines 390* and *411*) using the values of $g(r)$.

The results are stored in the corresponding columns of `array` (*lines 391* to *392*, and *lines  412* to *413*) to generate output in the format described in the LAMMPS manual (that is,  the bin midpoint in the first column, $g(r)$ values in the next column, the coordination  number in the third column, and repeating the $g(r)$ and coordination numbers in  successive columns for any additional atom type pairs).

It should be noted that `compute RDF` calculates the average $g(r)$ and the coordination  number for a simulation snapshot at a single timestep. To find the time-average of these  quantities over a desired number of iterations, the `fix ave/time` command needs  to be used in the LAMMPS input script, as outlined in the LAMMPS manual.

In this section, we covered `compute RDF`, which makes extensive use of 2D arrays to  generate 2D output via rows and columns of numeric values. In the next section, we'll  review `compute heat flux` as our final example.

## Reviewing the compute heat flux class

In this section, we will study the source code for the compute `heat flux` class, which  is contained in `compute_heat_flux.cpp` and `compute_heat_flux.h`.

The `compute heat flux` class accepts the per-atom kinetic energy, per-atom potential  energy, and per-atom stress to calculate the heat flow (J). This can be calculated  as follows:

$$J=\frac{1}{V}[\sum_{i}{e_i\vec {v_i}}-\sum_{i}{S_i\vec {v_i}}]$$

In this equation, $e_i$ represents the sum of kinetic and potential energies of atom `i`, $\vec {v_i}$ represents the velocity vector $(v_{xi},v_{yi},v_{zi})$ of atom `i`, $S_i$ represents the stress tensor of atom `i` and `V` represents the volume occupied by the atoms in consideration. The summation of $e_i\vec {v_i}$ is the convective part of the heat flux, while the summation of $S_i\vec {v_i}$ is the virial part of the heat flux.

Therefore, this compute needs to read the kinetic energy, potential energy, and stress of  atoms dynamically, and this is facilitated by feeding these quantities as other computes.  So, effectively, `compute heat flux` accepts three other computes as input parameters  that are evaluated every iteration to update the required quantities. 

The stress tensor (`S`) of an atom is represented in terms of its components, $S_{ij}$  , as follows:

$$S=\begin{bmatrix} 
S_{xx}&S_{xy}&S_{xz} \\
S_{yx}&S_{yy}&S_{yz} \\
S_{zx}&S_{zy}&S_{zz} \end{bmatrix}$$

Accordingly, the tensor product, $S\vec {v}$, is calculated as follows:

$$
S\vec {v}=
\begin{bmatrix} 
S_{xx}&S_{xy}&S_{xz} \\
S_{yx}&S_{yy}&S_{yz} \\
S_{zx}&S_{zy}&S_{zz} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 
V_x \\
V_y \\
V_z
\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix} 
S_{xx}V_x&S_{xy}V_y&S_{xz}V_z \\
S_{yx}V_x&S_{yy}V_y&S_{yz}V_z \\
S_{zx}V_x&S_{zy}V_y&S_{zz}V_z 
\end{bmatrix}$$

The tensor, S, is symmetric along its diagonal (that is, $S_{xy}=S_{yx}, S_{xz}=S_{zx}, S_{yz}=S_{zy}$ if it is returned by `compute stress/atom`, though it can be asymmetric if is returned by `compute centroid/stress/atom`. In the case of a symmetric `S`, there are six unique elements that are stored in LAMMPS as a six-element 1D array ($S_{xx}, S_{yy}, S_{zz}, S_{xy}, S_{xz}, S_{yz}$).

In the case of an asymmetric `S`, the components are stored in a nine-element 1D array ($S_{xx}, S_{yy}, S_{zz}, S_{xy}, S_{xz}, S_{yz},S_{yx}, S_{zx}, S_{zy}$). In `commpute_heat_flux.cpp`, the components are accessed from these arrays when calculating the tensor product, $S\vec {v}$, in the heat flow, $J$, as will be demonstrated in this section.

The LAMMPS inputs script command used to implement `compute heat flux` is 
as follows:

```
compute COMPUTE_ID GROUP heat/flux KE PE STRESS 
```

In the preceding code, the `COMPUTE_ID` parameter is the unique ID of the compute,  while the `GROUP` parameter is the ID of the group of atoms that the compute acts on (see  manual: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_heat_flux.html). The  `KE`, `PE`, and `STRESS` computes calculate the per-atom kinetic energy, per-atom potential  energy, and per-atom stress that are used in the computation of heat flux, respectively.  These computes should apply to the atoms in `GROUP`. 

In the header file, `compute_heat_flux.h`, 1D character arrays are declared to parse the compute names that are entered (*line 35*):

```
 char *id_ke,*id_pe,*id_stress;
```

Similarly, `compute` objects are declared to evaluate the computes that are entered (*line 36*):

```
 class Compute *c_ke,*c_pe,*c_stress;
```

In `compute_heat_flux.cpp`, we start by analyzing the constructor that parses these computes.

### ComputeHeatFlux::ComputeHeatFlux()
The following screenshot shows the `ComputeHeatFlux()` constructor method:

</div>

Figure 6.14 – Code snippet from compute_heat_flux.cpp showing the constructor method

As you can see, the three compute names for kinetic energy (*lines 47* to *49*), potential  energy (*lines 51* to *53*), and stress (*lines 55* to *57*) are parsed as character arrays; that is,  `id_ke[]`, `id_pe[]`, and `id_stress[]`, respectively. The corresponding compute IDs  are located by the `modify->find_compute()` methods in *lines 59* to *61*, and an error  is returned if the compute IDs do not exist (*lines 62* to *63*). Then, *lines 64* to *71* check  whether the computes that were entered specifically calculate the per-atom kinetic energy,  per-atom potential energy, and per-atom stress. An output vector of length 6 is created  (*line 73*) before closing this method.

Further error checks are performed in the `init()` method, as discussed next.

### ComputeHeatFlux::init()
The `init()` method, as shown in the following screenshot, checks if the compute names that were parsed in the constructor exist (*lines 92* to *96*):

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_15.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.15 – Code snippet from compute_heat_flux.cpp showing the init() method

As you can see, the compute objects – that is, `c_ke`, `c_pe`, and `c_stress` (*lines 98*  to *100*) – are tagged as the computes for calculating per-atom kinetic energy, per-atom  potential energy, and per-atom stress, respectively.

Next, the heat flux is calculated in the `compute_vector()` method.

### ComputeHeatFlux::compute_vector()
In the `compute_vector()` method, the computes are invoked if they have not been  invoked yet (*lines 111* to *122*), and the `ke[]`, `pe[]`, and `stress[][]` arrays are used  to extract the required values for the kinetic energy, potential energy, and stress of each  atom, respectively (*lines 129* to *131*). 

In *line 142*, the symmetry of the stress tensor, `S`, is determined by the `pressatomflag` flag, which is set to `1` for a symmetric tensor computed by `compute stress/atom`  (see `compute_stress_atom.cpp`) or to `2` for an asymmetric tensor computed by  `compute centroid/stress/atom` (see `compute_centroid_stress_atom. cpp`). Based on this symmetry, the tensor product, $S_i\vec {v}_i$ , for atom i is computed  differently, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=ch06/fig6_16.jpg>
</div>

Figure 6.16 – Code snippet from compute_heat_flux.cpp showing the compute_vector() method

As you can see, the case of the asymmetric S tensor (where `pressatomflag` is `2`) is  calculated in *lines 143* to *168*. While looping over all the atoms in the core (*line 143*)  and selecting atoms belonging to the specified group (*line 144*), the sum of kinetic and  potential energies for atom `i`($e_i$) is calculated as the eng variable (*line 145*). In *lines 146*  to *148*, the `jc[]` array calculates the three components of the convective part:

- For the x-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jc[0]=\sum_{i}{e_iv_{xi}}$$

- For the y-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jc[1]=\sum_{i}{e_iv_{yi}}$$

- For the z-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jc[2]=\sum_{i}{e_iv_{zi}}$$

The components of the virial part of the heat flux are calculated as the `jv[]` array, which is calculated from the stress of each atom. In the case of asymmetric `S`, the array element  of `stress[][]` accesses the following components of the stress of atom `i`:

- `stress[i][0]` = $S_{xx}$
- `stress[i][1]` = $S_{yy}$
- `stress[i][2]` = $S_{zz}$
- `stress[i][3]` = $S_{xy}$
- `stress[i][4]` = $S_{xz}$
- `stress[i][5]` = $S_{yz}$
- `stress[i][6]` = $S_{yx}$
- `stress[i][7]` = $S_{zx}$
- `stress[i][8]` = $S_{zy}$

Using the preceding stress components, the three components of the virial part, `jv[]`, are  calculated (*lines 159* to *166*):

- For the x-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[0]=-\sum_{i}{s_{xxi}v_{xi}+s_{xyi}v_{yi}+s_{xzi}v_{zi}}$$
- For the y-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[1]=-\sum_{i}{s_{yxi}v_{xi}+s_{yyi}v_{yi}+s_{yzi}v_{zi}}$$
- For the z-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[2]=-\sum_{i}{s_{zxi}v_{xi}+s_{zyi}v_{yi}+s_{zzi}v_{zi}}$$

Then, in the case of a symmetric tensor, `S`, the convective part, `jc[]`, of the heat flux  is calculated in the same way as before (*lines 172* to *175*) and the virial part, `jv[]`, is  calculated using the `stress[i][0]` to `stress[i][5]` elements, which access the stress components $(S_{xx},S_{yy},S_{zz},S_{xy},S_{xz},S_{yz})$  in the given order. The components of   `jv[]` thus look as follows (*lines 176* to *181*):

- For the x-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[0]=-\sum_{i}{s_{xxi}v_{xi}+s_{xyi}v_{yi}+s_{xzi}v_{zi}}$$

- For the y-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[1]=-\sum_{i}{s_{xyi}v_{xi}+s_{yyi}v_{yi}+s_{yzi}v_{zi}}$$

- For the z-component, we use the following equation:
	$$jv[2]=-\sum_{i}{s_{xzi}v_{xi}+s_{yzi}v_{yi}+s_{zzi}v_{zi}}$$

Once the convective and virial parts have been computed, the virial part, `jv[]`, is  converted into the same units as the convective part, `jc[]`, by scaling by the proper units  of pressure (*lines 188* to *191*). Finally, the `data[]` array is created (*line 197*) with the  elements, as shown in the following code:

```
 double data[6] = 
{jc[0]+jv[0],jc[1]+jv[1],jc[2]+jv[2],jc[0],jc[1],jc[2]};
```

From the preceding code, the summations of these six elements over all cores are then  retrieved by the `MPI_A llreduce()` call (*line 198*) and returned as the 1D output  `vector` array declared in the `compute.h` parent class.

It should be noted that while the volume, `V`, is included in the equation for calculating the  heat flux, `J`, the volume does not appear in the source code of compute `heat flux`.  Therefore, the volume has to be separately incorporated (for example, in a separate  compute or variable command) to calculate the correct heat flux.

This concludes this section, where we discussed a compute that accepts other computes  as input parameters to calculate the heat flux. 

## Summary

In this chapter, we examined computes that calculate a global quantity, identify  interactions between groups, tally distances over ranges and perform tensor  multiplications. These computes illustrate the scope of processing and computations that  can be carried out by proper implementations inside the compute style source codes.

By reading this chapter, you understand that computes can calculate and return scalar  and vector quantities when properly defined, and that neighbor lists can be implemented  in computes by requesting and accessing them with a pointer. In addition, combining  outputs from multiple cores is facilitated by the `MPI_Allreduce()` method.

In the next chapter, we will analyze selected fix styles that can perform a variety of  operations on the simulated system during a simulation run.
