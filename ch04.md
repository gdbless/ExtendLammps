# 4 Accessing Information by Variables, Arrays, and Methods

In this chapter, we will describe how to access physical quantities, such as the position, velocity, and force of an atom, which are relevant to MD simulations, using internal LAMMPS variables and methods. These methods and variables are coded into the classes (which are located in the src folder) described in the previous chapters.

We will cover the following topics: 

- Accessing atom properties

- Mapping local and global atom indices

- Requesting a neighbor list

- Accessing physical constants

- Reading input parameters from the input script

By the end of this chapter, you will know how to use these handles to access essential simulation data, such as the system status and particle properties, as well as how to use the proper methods to negotiate common simulation scenarios encountered in MD.

## Accessing atom properties during simulation runs
In this section, we will learn how to access the properties of atoms during a simulation run using the `Atom` class.

The Atom class represented in `atom.cpp` and `atom.h` provides access to various atom properties, including the atom type, molecular ID, position, velocity, and force. These quantities are listed in the atom.h header file, as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_1.png>
</div>

Figure 4.1 – A code snippet from atom.h

These quantities can be accessed from other classes by importing this header file into their `.cpp` files:

```
#include "atom.h"
```

Variables can be declared to read these quantities by using arrow operators that point to quantities in `atom.h`. For example, as you can see in the preceding screenshot, to access the position of an atom defined by x in `atom.h` (*line 58*), we use the following line:

```
double **x = atom->x;
```

Here, ** indicates that x is stored as a 2D array, where one dimension represents the atom index and the other represents the three x, y, and z coordinates. To access the three coordinates of an atom with index i and to store them as `x1`, `y1`, and `z1` variables, we can type the following:

```
double x1 = x[i][0];
double y1 = x[i][1];
double z1 = x[i][2];
```

While per-atom vector quantities such as the position, velocity, and force are stored in 2D arrays, per-atom scalar quantities such as atom types and molecule types are stored in 1D arrays. Additionally, global quantities such as the number of atom types in a system are stored as single variables. The following points present an inventory of selected quantities from atom.h:

- `double **x = atom->x`: This returns the position of an atom as *x[i][w]*, where *i* represents the atom index, and w=0,1,2 represents the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.

- `double **v = atom->v`: This returns the velocity of an atom as *v[i][w]*, where *i* represents the atom index, and w=0,1,2 represents the x, y, and z components, respectively. 

- `double **f = atom->f`: This returns the total force acting of an atom as *f[i] [w]*, where i represents the atom index, and w=0,1,2 represents the x, y, and z components, respectively.

- `int *type = atom->type`: This returns the atom type of an atom as *type[i]*,  where *i* represents the atom index; the value returned corresponds to the atom type designated during initialization in the input script or supporting data file.

- `tagint *molecule = atom->molecule`: This returns the molecule ID of an atom as *molecule[i]*, where *i* represents the atom index. This command is useful for identifying atoms that belong to the same molecule.

- `bigint natoms = atom->natoms`: This returns the total number of atoms in a system.

- `int nlocal = atom->nlocal`: This returns the number of owned atoms  belonging to the core that executes this line. When multiple cores are employed, each core is only able to manipulate atoms or ghost atoms contained in its domain. 

- `int molecular = atom->molecular`: This returns the type of atom style used in the input script, where the output values of 0,1,2 are used to represent an atomic system, a molecular system, and a molecular template system, respectively.

- `int *num_bond = atom->num_bond`: This returns the number of bonds of an  atom as *num_bond[i]*, where *i* represents the atom index.

- `tagint **bond_atom = atom->bond_atom`: This returns the index of the  bonded atom as *bond_atom[i][j]*, where *i* represents the atom index, and *j* represents the bond index. The output value is the index of the atom bonded to atom i at its bond with index, *j*. Additionally, the output atom index corresponds to the global atom ID designated in the input script and data file instead of the local atom index.

The ID of an atom can be described by a local index or a global index that needs to be handled properly when writing code. This concept is described in more detail in the next section.

## Mapping atom indices

The atom ID specified in an input script or a data file read by an input script is considered a **global** atom ID, whereas a different **local** atom index is used by individual cores that range from 0 to (`nlocal-1`) of the processor.

As explained in *Chapter 1, MD Theory and Simulation Practices*, each core in a multi-core system is assigned a certain number of owned atoms for which it performs calculations. When accessing information using the Atom class, as described previously, the local index must be used as input and the individual core uses this index to calculate the required output.

We use the following commands to convert from a global to a local index and vice versa:

- Converting from global index `G` to local index `L`: 

    ```
    int L = atom->map(G);
    ```

- Converting from local index `L` to global index `G`:

    ```
    tagint *tag = atom->tag;
    int G = tag[L];
    ```

The `atom->map()` function returns -1 if the input atom ID is not present.

In this section, we learned about various atom properties and the various quantities used to access them, along with the codes to convert between global indices and local indices.

During an MD simulation, a **neighbor list** is often required to account for the interactions of an atom with its neighbors, and hence it has to be incorporated within the same class that reads atom properties. In the next section, we will describe how to call a neighbor list and identify neighbors.

## Requesting a neighbor list

In this section, we will learn how to initialize and access a neighbor list for individual atoms.

The neighbor list is controlled by the `NeighList` class represented by `neigh_list.cpp` and `neigh_list.h`. When a neighbor list is requested, the system neighbor list is generated by neighbour.cpp, and access to various elements of the neighbor list is facilitated by the `Neighlist` class.

In the case of pair styles, the neighbor list is created in `pair.h` and is inherited by the child pair classes; this is depicted as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_2.png>
</div>

Figure 4.2 – Code snippet from pair.h

A neighbor list is requested by the `Pair:init_style()` method, as shown in *Figure 3.6 from Chapter 3, Source Code Structure and Stages of Execution*. A full, or a half, neighbor list can be requested as required. In the case of fixes, the `fix.h` parent class does not request a neighbor list, so individual child fix classes need to request it when required. In the following screenshot, we show the neighbor list request implemented in `fix_orient_fcc.cpp` (which is located in the `src/MISC` folder):

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_3.png>
</div>

Figure 4.3 – Code snippet from fix_orient_fcc.cpp showing the init() and init_list() methods

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, on *line 221*, the `init()` method shows the request, and *lines 222* to *225* specify a full neighbor list applicable to a fix, as opposed to a half neighbor list applicable to a pair style. Then, an `init_list()` method needs to be introduced to get hold of the neighbor list pointer, with a placeholder named `list`.

Once the pointer has been obtained, the following neighbor list elements are commonly accessed:

- `int inum = list->inum`: This returns the number of atoms for which  neighbor lists have been determined.

- `int *ilist = list->ilist`: This returns the local indices of atoms as  `ilist[ii]`, where ii is the index of the same atom designated between 0 and (`inum-1`) according to its position in the neighbor list array.

- `int *numneigh = list->numneigh`: This returns the number of neighbors  of each atom as `numneigh[i]`, where `i` is the local atom index.

- int **firstneigh = list->firstneigh: This returns the local index  of the neighboring atom as `firstneigh[i][j]`, where `i` represents the central atom local index, and `j` represents the neighboring atom index. The `j` index is not the local atom index but is designated between 0 and (`numneigh[i]-1`), that is, according to its position in the neighbor list. The output value is the local atom index of the neighboring atom, `j`, of the central atom, `i`.

The following diagram illustrates the aforementioned architecture of the neighbor list and their quantities:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_4.png>
</div>

Figure 4.4 – Architecture of the neighbor list showing the inum, ilist, numneigh, and firstneigh quantities

As you can see in the preceding diagram, when considering all of the owned atoms in a core and calculating their interactions with the atoms in their neighbor lists, a common strategy is to loop over all the central atoms, inum, for which neighbor lists exist and to iteratively loop over the neighbors of each of these central atoms.

In the first loop over inum (with index `ii`), the local atom index (`i`) of each central atom is extracted (`i = ilist[ii]`), the number of neighbors for the atom (`jnum`) is retrieved (`jnum = numneigh[i]`), and an array of neighbors (`jlist`) is created (`jlist = firstneigh[i]`).

A second loop (with index `jj`) located inside the first loop traverses over all neighbors jnum of atom `i`, and extracts the local atom index (`j`) of each neighbor (`j = jlist[jj]`). In effect, `jlist[jj]` returns the same output as `firstneigh[i][jj]`.

The following code lines illustrate this process:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_5.png>
</div>

Figure 4.5 – Typical code that accesses neighbor lists (left) with annotations (right)

As you can see, in this way, all atoms with neighbor lists are accounted for and their neighbors are identified. Additionally, their atom indices can be used to access atom properties, such as atom positions to calculate the separation between a central atom and each of its neighbors.

In this section, we learned about the structure of neighbor lists and how to call them inside pair styles and fix styles.

Other than dynamic simulation features, LAMMPS provides access to a repository of physical constants commonly used in atomic simulations. These constants are hardcoded in the source code, and we will describe them in the next section.

## Accessing physical constants
 
Physical constants in different units used in LAMMPS (for example, SI, "real", and "metal") are available using arrow operators from `force.h`. A list of these constants is shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_6.png>
</div>

Figure 4.6 – Screenshot from force.h showing the variables used to implement physical constants

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, `force.h` only contains the variables names that represent the various physical constants. The numeric values of these constants are provided in `update.cpp`, which imports `force.h` and assigns values to these variables in the `Update::set_units()` method, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_7.png>
</div>

Figure 4.7 – Code snippet from update.cpp that assigns numeric values to variables representing physical constants

The constants in the correct unit are retrieved by the `Update::set_units()` method when they are accessed from other classes. For example, the following code lines return the Boltzmann constant to a boltz variable:

```
#include "force.h"
double boltz = force->boltz;
```

The unit does not need to be specified in the class and will be automatically determined by the units used in the LAMMPS input script.

So far, we have discussed accessing quantities generated by the source code. Next, we will discuss parsing parameters entered in the LAMMPS input script using various methods offered in the `force.cpp` class.

## Reading parameters from the input script

In this section, we will learn about parsing parameters entered by a user in the LAMMPS input script. In *Chapter 3, Source Code Structure and Stages of Execution*, the role of `input.cpp` in parsing the first words of input script commands was discussed. In this section, we will discuss the methods responsible for parsing user-entered quantities associated with various commands.

User-entered parameters associated with various styles, such as numeric pair coefficient values in pair styles and force values in fixes, are parsed from the LAMMPS input script by the corresponding classes or their parent classes. 

**Important Note**:
These methods are located in `force.cpp` in the LAMMPS stable version, **3Mar20**, whereas they have been moved to `utils.cpp` in the stable version, **29Oct20**. Please refer to Appendix D for more information about version compatibility.

The parsing of these quantities is performed by the `force.cpp` class through several methods that are discussed next:

- Here is a screenshot of the `Force::numeric()` method, which reads floating point numbers from an input script:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_8.png>
</div>

Figure 4.8 – A code snippet from force.cpp showing the numeric() method

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, when the `Force::numeric()` method reads an input string of text, it returns an error if there is a null or empty input (*line 940*) and validates that the string contains only digits and the +, -, ., e, and E symbols (*lines 945* to *951*). Once validated, the string is parsed as a floating- point number (*line 954*).

- Similarly, the `Force::inumeric()` method reads integers from manually entered text:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_9.png>
</div>

Figure 4.9 – A code snippet from force.cpp showing the inumeric() method

This method follows a similar set of rules as `Force::numeric()`, except that it only permits the + and - symbols in the input string (*lines 973* to *977*). The validated string is returned as an integer (*line 980*).

- Other methods include `Force::bnumeric()` and `Force::tnumeric()`,  which read big integers (such as the number of atoms in a system) and tag integers (such as atom and molecule IDs), respectively; this is described in more detail in `lmptype.h`. When reading atom types that must be constrained to integers between 1 and the number of types of atoms specified, the `Force::bounds()` method can be used to validate the input string:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_10.png>
</div>

Figure 4.10 – A code snippet from force.cpp showing the bounds() method

This method accommodates the use of an * symbol when defining atom types in pair styles (*lines 873* to *889*), as described in the LAMMPS manual (https:// lammps.sandia.gov/doc/). The correct lower and upper bounds of the atom types are returned as `nlo` and `nhi` integers, and an error is generated if the atom types violate the permitted ranges, or if the first atom type is larger than the second atom type (*line 891* to *892*).

**Important Note**:
The `force->` methods are used in LAMMPS version **3Mar20**, while `utils::` methods are used in version **29Oct20**. Please refer to *Appendix D* for a detailed discussion.

- The following excerpt from `pair_morse.cpp` shows some of the preceding  methods being used to read parameters from the input script regarding `pair style Morse` (the Morse pair style and its arguments will be described in more detail when we analyze pair styles in *Chapter 5, Understanding Pair Styles*): 

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_11.png>
</div>

Figure 4.11 – A code snippet from pair_morse.cpp showing input parameters as parsed by methods from force.cpp

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, *lines 184* to *185* use the `force- >bound()` method to read the atom types that have this pair style implemented between them. In the arguments of the `force->bounds()` method, `arg[0]` and `arg[1]` refer to the first and second atom types entered in the input script.

*Lines 187* to *189* use the `force->numeric()` method to read the floating-point parameters, `d0_one`, `alpha_one`, and `r0_one`, from the three consecutive parameters entered after the atom types. The `FLERR` flag, which is used as the first argument in these methods, is defined in `pointers.h` (*line 34*):

```
#define FLERR __FILE__,__LINE__
```

This flag combines the filename and the line number into a single argument, and it accounts for the first two arguments required in each of these methods.

When executing a style where a user-entered value is expected (for example, a pair style or a fix), the relevant source code employs an appropriate method to parse these values from their correct locations in the input script line. This process will be illustrated in more detail in the chapters that follow when such styles are analyzed.

In this section, we learned about the methods used to parse input script parameters. These methods will be frequently encountered when we cover classes that require input from the LAMMPS script (for example, pair styles, computes, and fixes).

In the next section, we will outline the process of incorporating new data types in LAMMPS, used to expand the functionalities offered in parsing and processing inputs.

## Incorporating new data types

When a certain data type does not exist in the standard C++ repository, it can be created and incorporated in the LAMMPS source code by defining it appropriately in `lmptype.h`. For example, the `tagint` data type described earlier in `tagint bond_atom = atom->bond_atom` is a variation of the int data type. This tagint data type has been defined in `lmptype.h`, as shown in the following screenshot: 

<div align=center>
<img src=fig4_12.png>
</div>

Figure 4.12 – Code snippet from lmptype.h showing the declaration of the tagint and bigint data types

As you can see, the built-in `typedef` function in C++ can be used to declare new data types with custom properties in `lmptype.h`, and these data types can be accessed in the rest of the source code. 

Generally, int is a 4-byte (32-bit) data type by default, which means it can accommodate a 10-digit number up to $2^{31}$ . Sometimes, if a simulation system has to accommodate a larger number, we can use typedef to alias the `int` (32 bit) and `int64_t` (64 bit) data types to tagint and bigint data types using macros in `lmptype.h`.

 
As seen in *Figure 4.12*, the `LAMMPS_SMALLBIG` definition (*line 77*) declares the `smallint`, `imageint`, and `tagint` data types as of the int type, whereas it declares the `bigint` data type as of the `int64_t` type (*lines 79* to *82*). Similarly, the `LAMMPS_BIGBIG` definition (*line 109*) declares `smallint` as of the `int` type and `imageint`, `tagint`, and `bigint` as of the `int64_t` type (*lines 111* to *114*).

The desired definition can be selected using the `–DLAMMPS-SIZES=value` or `LMP_INC = -DLAMMPS_SMALLBIG` options in CMake and Make, respectively, during compilation (see details in *Appendix A, Building LAMMPS with CMake*). 

The following table lists the ranges accommodated by the `LAMMPS_BIGBIG`,`LAMMPS_SMALLBIG`, and `LAMMPS_SMALLSMALL` definitions selected during compilation (*lines 109*, *77*, and *140*):

<div align=center>
<img src=table4_1.png>
</div>

Table 4.1 – List of ranges of number of atoms, number of timesteps, atom IDs, and image flag values accommodated by the available definitions in lmptype.h

The image flag value keeps track of the multiple of the simulation box length traveled by an atom through the periodic boundary in each dimension (see *Chapter 1, MD Theory and Simulation Practices*). To account for the three *(x, y, z)* dimensions, the number of available bits are shared equally by the three dimensions.

Therefore, if 32 bits are available (as in `LAMMPS_SMALLBIG` and `LAMMPS_SMALLSMALL`), each dimension is assigned 10 bits, which effectively allows a range of $2^{10}$ integers, spanning from $-2^9$ to ($2^9-1$). Similarly, for `LAMMPS_BIGBIG`, the available 64 bits are divided into from shares of 21 bits in each dimension that span a range of $-2^{20}$ to ($2^{20}-1$) integers from 

A more detailed discussion is available in the LAMMPS manual (https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Library_utility.html).

In this section, the declaration of custom data types and the ranges spanned by various definitions have been explained. In the context of accessing information in the source code, the topics described in this section will help users understand the associated limitations.

## Summary
In this chapter, we have described the different ways in which to access relevant pieces of MD information during a simulation run using built-in methods, which will be useful to users when writing custom codes. We have not provided an exhaustive list of quantities that can be accessed, and as we analyze styles in detail in the following chapters, we will encounter other variables and methods that will be explained as they are encountered.

In the next chapter, we will employ the concepts covered so far to analyze sample pair styles to gain a hands-on understanding of how these styles read, calculate, and generate outputs. Since most new features added to LAMMPS are created by modifying existing features, this overview of existing styles will be particularly helpful when implementing new LAMMPS features.

## Questions

1. What do the * and ** symbols preceding variable names imply regarding their memory allocation?

2. What information is contained in the firstneigh array that is commonly created during neighbor list requests?

3. When should the `force->inumeric()` method be used instead of the `force->numeric()` method to parse input from a script?
