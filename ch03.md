# Source Code Structure and Stages of Execution

Continuing from the previous chapter, this chapter will further illustrate the source code hierarchy by describing parent and child classes in the source code. The various methods used in some of these classes will also be discussed. To complete the picture, the flow of control from top-level classes to the code termination stage will be explained using the sequence of execution of methods as determined by the integrator.

This chapter is intended to complete your understanding of the source code hierarchy and flow, which will help you to identify code sections that need modifications when implementing custom features.

We will cover the following topics:


- Parent and child classes in the source code

- The stages of executing the simulation within each timestep

- The role played by `pointers.h`

- Parsing input script commands by `input.cpp`

## Introducing parent and child classes

As mentioned in *Chapter 2, LAMMPS Syntax and Source Code Hierarchy*, certain styles are given in the source code that can support child classes. These styles serve as parent classes and their child classes inherit their methods, thereby ensuring a degree of uniformity in the child classes that makes classification and syntax synthesis more streamlined. In this section, we will describe some of these parent classes and some of the inherited methods in their child classes.

### fix.cpp and fix.h
These are the parent classes of all fixes used in LAMMPS. Among other purposes, they read the first three arguments common to all fixes (fix ID, group ID, and fix style) and sets up energy or virial computations. The following screenshot shows the code snippet from `fix.cpp` that invokes an instance of LAMMPS and reads the three common arguments:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_1.png>
</div>

Figure 3.1 - Code snippet from fix.cpp

All fixes inherit these three arguments from `fix.cpp`, along with the methods that set up computations. A typical fix child class that inherits from the `fix.cpp` parent contains the following lines (extracted from `fix_addforce.cpp`):

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_2.png>
</div>

Figure 3.2 – fixaddforce.cpp inheriting from fix.cpp

This child fix class inherits the three arguments from its parent class and reads the arguments specific to itself afterward. Similarly, `fix.h` stores a list of variables shared by all fix child classes, as shown:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_3.png>
</div>

Figure 3.3 - Code snippet from fix.h

Child fix header classes inherit these variables by including `fix.h`:

```
#include "fix.h"
```

This way, all child fixes share common syntax and variables, such as id, igroup, and style to store fix ID, group ID, and fix style, respectively.

For example, a fix command is entered in the LAMMPS input script:

```
fix F1 all nvt temp 100 100 0.1
```
The quantities are parsed as described:

- `fix`: This is the type of command, registered by input.cpp.

- `F1`: This is the name of fix, parsed by `fix.cpp`.

- `all`: This is the group name, parsed by f`ix.cpp`.

- `nvt`: This is the style of fix, parsed by `fix.cpp`.

- `temp, 100, 100, 0.1`: These are the keywords specific to the fix, parsed by the fix child class.


### pair.cpp and pair.h
These parent classes initialize all pair styles by validating that all pair coefficients have been specified, applying mixing rules when required, determining cutoff, requesting neighbor lists, and setting up computations. The following screenshots show some of the code segments from pair.cpp that execute these tasks. First, let's see the pair coefficient assignment:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_4.png>
</div>

Figure 3.4 - Code snippets from pair.cpp showing code for pair coefficient assignment

Next, here's a screenshot of mixing coefficients:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_5.png>
</div>

Figure 3.5 - Code snippets from pair.cpp showing code for mixing coefficients

Finally, we'll see code for requesting the default neighbor list:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_6.png>
</div>

Figure 3.6 - Code snippets from pair.cpp showing code for requesting the default neighbor list

By including pair.h, child pair classes can inherit variables, classes, and methods used for implementing pair potentials between atoms and computing relevant quantities, including the following:

- `cutforce`: This is the maximum cutoff distance for all atom pairs.

- `cutsq`: This is the pointer that stores the square of the cutoff for each atom pair.

- `list`: This is the pointer to the neighbor list used in most pair potential calculations.

- `compute`: This is the method to compute forces between atom pairs.

- `single`: This is the method to calculate pair interaction energy.

The pair coefficients and cutoff, after both the `pair_style` and `pair_coeff` commands in the input script, are read from the child pair classes instead of the parent class.

When multiple types of potentials need to be implemented using a `pair_style hybrid` command, `pair_hybrid.cpp` creates a different pair style for each style specified and maps each atom pair to the correct pair style, as shown in the following screenshots. First, we will have a look at the snippet to show pair style creation:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_7.png>
</div>

Figure 3.7 - Code snippets from pair_hybrid.cpp showing pair style creation

And next, we will see the pair style mapping:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_8.png>
</div>

Figure 3.8 - Code snippets from pair_hybrid.cpp showing pair style mapping

When pair potentials are superimposed by using the `pair_style hybrid/overlay` command, `pair_hybrid_overlay.cpp` carries out similar tasks along with the option of mapping multiple pair potentials for the same atom pairs.

### compute.cpp and compute.h
The parent classes for all computes read the first three arguments, similar to fix classes, and allows the child classes to read the remaining arguments, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_9.png>
</div>

Figure 3.9 - Code snippet from compute.cpp

This way, all child computes share the `id`, `igroup`, and `style` variables to store the fix ID, group ID, and compute style, respectively. Similarly, child classes inherit variables from `compute.h`, including `scalar` and `vector`, which are used as outputs of typical computes.

Each `.cpp` file corresponding to a class contains several methods that perform different functions at different stages of the simulation. The sequence of executing methods in the correct order is carried out by an integrator, such as the Verlet class in `verlet.cpp`. The Verlet class is a child class of integrate.cpp, which in turn is initiated by the top-level class, `update.cpp`. In the next section, we describe the control of flow determined by `verlet.cpp`.

## Stages of executing the simulation

A LAMMPS simulation is executed by iterating over timesteps (for example, **velocity Verlet integration**) or through algorithms that do not perform timestepping (for example, **minimization**). Next, we will describe the Verlet integration scheme as implemented in verlet.cpp and then briefly outline the minimization scheme implemented in `min.cpp`.


### verlet.cpp
The `verlet.cpp` class implements timestepping through a series of methods that are executed in a pre-defined order. At the beginning of a timestep, the following methods in `verlet.cpp` are called:

- `init()`: This method checks whether fixes are defined in the input script and sets up flags for arrays, shown as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_10.png>
</div>

Figure 3.10 – Code snippet from verlet.ccp showing the init() method

- `force_clear()`: This method clears forces on all atoms to store combined forces during the course of the timestep:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_11.png>
</div>

Figure 3.11 - Code snippet from verlet.ccp showing the force_clear() method

- `setup()`: This method sets up domains with ghost atoms and builds neighbor lists; then computes forces as required to perform position and velocity updates in the velocity Verlet algorithm: 

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_12.png>
</div>

Figure 3.12 - Code snippet from verlet.ccp showing the setup() method

The rest of the steps in the timestep are conducted by the `run()` method. This method invokes other sequence-control methods in a predefined order, which in turn invoke fixes at the corresponding points within the same timestep. The following screenshot from the `run()` method shows the sequence of execution:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_13.png>
</div>

Figure 3.13 - Code snippet showing run() from verlet.cpp

Here is a table that shows us a list of some of these methods in chronological order:

<div align=center>
<img src=table3_1.png>
</div>

Table 3.1 – Table showing a list of methods

Every fix is assigned a sequence-control method to determine its order of execution, as will be described in *Chapter 7, Understanding Fixes*. The `modify.cpp` class stores all fixes and calls these methods at the appropriate points in the timestep, thereby facilitating the execution of all fixes in the specified order. The list of methods is imported from `modify.h` into `verlet.cpp`. The screenshot from `modify.h` shows a list of these methods in the order of execution:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_14.png>
</div>

Figure 3.14 - Code snippet showing methods from modify.h

When writing a custom fix, the exact location of executing the fix can be specified by incorporating one or more of the preceding methods in the fix. 

### min.cpp
The `min.cpp` class, which is also initiated by update.cpp, uses a non-timestepping algorithm to perform minimization. Similar to a timestepping algorithm, force computations, neighbor list builds, and atom designation to processors are performed. However, different fix class sequence-control methods are called: `min_pre_ exchange()`, `min_pre_force()`, and `min_post_force()`. Fixes that incorporate these methods can be called during minimization.

So far, we have covered the source code hierarchy and the control flow dictated during timestepping or non-timestepping procedures that call different classes in the source code (please see the LAMMPS manual at https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Developer.html for more information). These classes are able to share information through the `Pointers` class (`pointers.h`), which contains pointers to the pointers listed in lammps.h, as is elaborated next.

## Role of pointers class

Role of pointers class The `pointers.h` file facilitated information transfer between classes by creating pointers to all important quantities listed in lammps.h. All classes inherit from pointers.h and are able to access these variables. The following screenshot illustrates the pointers created:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_15.png>
</div>

Figure 3.15 - Code snippets from pointers.h showing (left) pointers to classes and (right) pointers to pointers in lammps.h
 
The pointers to different classes are created, as well as pointers to pointers listed in `lammps.h`, indicated by `*&` at the front. This way, variables from `lammps.h` can be accessed from other classes directly by declaring proper pointers, as will be explained in later chapters.

In the next section of this chapter, we will describe how input script commands are parsed using a pre-defined list of permitted commands in `input.cpp`.

## Parsing input script commands by input.cpp

In this section, the parsing of input script commands is described as handled by the `execute_command()` method in `input.cpp`, along with the steps followed after each command.

The execute_command() method in input.cpp is responsible for parsing the first word of each line of the input script. This method contains a list of permitted commands that are compared with the first word of each line. An error is returned if there is no match, and pre-defined methods in `input.cpp` are called for each match. This method is called within the `file()` method and the `one()` method in `input.cpp` to facilitate parsing and execution.

The following screenshot shows the `execute_command()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_16.png>
</div>

Figure 3.16 – The execute_command() method in input.cpp containing a list of permitted input script commands

As you can see, in the preceding screenshot, the command variable represents the first word of the line being parsed, and it is compared with the list of permitted commands. For example, if the word `clear` is matched (*line 783*), the `clear()` method in `input.cpp` will be invoked, as shown in the following screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_17.png>
</div>

Figure 3.17 – The clear() method in input.cpp

As you can see, the `clear()` method is self-contained and effectively deletes previous instances of LAMMPS and presents a fresh platform to continue.

Similarly, if the word `lattice` is matched (*line 824*), the `lattice()` method in `input.cpp` is invoked, as shown in the next screenshot:

<div align=center>
<img src=fig3_18.png>
</div>

Figure 3.18 – The lattice() method in input.cpp

As you can see, in the `lattice()` method, the `domain->set_lattice()` method is invoked, which opens `domain.cpp` for further execution.

Methods are invoked for other commands including `fix` and `pair_style`, and often, external classes are called to continue the simulation. Adding new permitted commands in the input script will require modifying this method to reflect these changes.

# Summary

In this chapter, the parent classes for fixes, pair potentials, and computes were introduced and their inheritance to child classes was outlined. The methods used to control the flow of execution were explained as well. These concepts will be beneficial when writing custom features, especially when establishing the sequence of execution.

Having covered the source code framework, in the next chapter, we will explore the different variables, methods, and arrays that represent physical quantities in MD simulations, such as the position, velocity, and force of atoms, which need to be implemented correctly to represent physical aspects of an MD model.
