# 5 Understanding Pair Styles

In this chapter, we will delve into some of the pair styles implemented in LAMMPS and analyze their source code to understand the roles performed by different sections of the code. Pair styles implement pair potentials between atoms according to the equations introduced in *Chapter 1, MD Theory and Simulation Practices*. In this chapter, we will look at how the mathematical operations involved are executed by pair style source code.

We will cover the following topics:

- Reviewing the general structure of pair styles

- Reviewing the Morse potential

- Reviewing the table potential

- Reviewing the DPD potential

At the end of this chapter, you will have explored the inner mechanism of several sample pair styles with the aid of the material presented in the previous chapters and will be prepared to make changes to existing pair styles to implement custom pair potentials in LAMMPS.

## Technical requirements
To execute the instructions in this chapter, you just need a text editor (for example, **Notepad++** or **Gedit**).

You can find the full source code used in this chapter here: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Extending-and-Modifying-LAMMPS-Writing-Your-Own-Source-Code

## Reviewing the general structure of pair styles
As described in *Chapter 3, Source Code Structure and Stages of Execution*, each individual pair style inherits from `pair.cpp` and `pair.h`, including the `init()` method.

In this section, we briefly cover the methods commonly used in the child pair style classes that are inherited from the `pair.cpp` and `pair.h` classes. 

The parent classes take care of validating pair coefficient assignments, mixing parameters, determining cutoff, requesting neighbor lists, and setting up computations. Some of the methods and variables are also inherited from `pair.h`. Hybrid styles are accommodated by the `pair_hybrid.cpp` and `pair_hybrid_overlay.cpp` classes.

The child pair style classes commonly contain the following methods:

- `allocate()` allocates memory to arrays used to calculate pair interaction forces.

- `settings()` reads and processes global pair potential parameters entered after the `pair_style` command in the LAMMPS input script.

- `coeff()` reads and processes local pair potential parameters entered after the `pair_coeff` command in the LAMMPS input script.

- `init_one()` assigns pairwise coefficients for all atom types.

- `compute()` calculates pairwise forces and potential between atom types.

- `single()` returns the pairwise potential to be used by other classes during the simulation run.

In the following sections, we will illustrate how the aforementioned methods are implemented in selected pair styles provided in the LAMMPS repository.

## Reviewing the Morse potential

In this section, we analyze the Morse potential implemented by the `pair_morse.cpp` and `pair_morse.h` classes.

The Morse potential $(V_{Morse})$ is used to represent the covalent character of bonds and consists of a repulsive and an attractive part with a potential minimum in between. The functional form of the Morse potential is given by the following:

$$V_{Morse}(r)=D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-2e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}]$$

From the preceding equation, $D_0$ represents the depth of the Morse potential well, $\alpha$ determines the curvature of the well, and $r_0$ represents the equilibrium distance. In a LAMMPS input script, the Morse pair potential is implemented using the following commands:

```
pair_style morse GLOBAL_CUTOFF
pair_coeff TYPE1 TYPE2 D0 ALPHA R0 LOCAL_CUTOFF
```

From the preceding code, D0, ALPHA, R0 are the three Morse parameters described, and the `GLOBAL_CUTOFF` and `LOCAL_CUTOFF` parameters are the cutoffs used for all atom pairs or specified atom pairs, respectively (described in detail in the LAMMPS manual: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_morse.html). The TYPE1 and TYPE2 parameters specify the pair of atom types that interact via the Morse potential.

In the following sections, we will illustrate how `pair_morse.cpp` and `pair_morse.h` facilitate the processing required to parse and implement the Morse potential in an MD simulation.

### PairMorse::allocate()
When implementing pair style Morse, the required arrays are created by the `allocate()` method, shown as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_1.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.1 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the `allocate()` method

As you can see from the preceding screenshot, the number of atom types is stored on *line 136* as n, and several 2D arrays of dimensions, (n+1)*(n+1), are created using the ``memory->create()`` function.

Each row and column starts at an index equal to 0 and continues to index n to represent all atom types in the rows and columns. *Lines 138* to *141* insert zeros to populate the 2D setflag array (see `pair.cpp` in *Chapter 3, Source Code Structure and Stages of Execution*), which checks whether pair styles have been declared between every pair of atom types.

You can see in *line 139* that populating the array starts at index i = 1 to correspond to atom types that also start from an index of 1 (while index i = 0 is excluded). Similar 2D arrays are created in *lines 143* to *150* to represent the square of the cutoff (`cutsq`), the cutoff (`cut`), $D_0$(`d0`), $\alpha (`alpha`)$, $r_0$ (`r0`), a constant based on $D_0(d0)$ and$\alpha$ (`morse1`), and the offset that shifts the potential to zero at the cutoff (`offset`) for every pair of atom types. These arrays will be populated by other methods and used to calculate the pair interactions.

Now let’s move on to the next method.

### PairMorse::settings()
This method reads the quantities entered in the LAMMPS input script after the `pair_style morse` command, which, in this case, is only the global cutoff. The following screenshot illustrates the `settings()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_2.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.2 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the `settings()` method

As you can see in the preceding screenshot, *line 159* checks whether there is exactly one parameter present in the LAMMPS input script after the `pair_style` morse command as specified in the LAMMPS manual and returns an error message if not.

Then, *line 161* reads this arg[0] parameter as a floating-point number using the ``force->numeric()`` method and stores it as the `cut_global` variable that has been declared in `pair_morse.h`. In *lines 165* to *170*, the cutoffs for all atom types (`cut[i][j]`) that have been allocated earlier are set to this global cutoff. Note that the i index traverses over all atom types 1 through n, but the j index traverses from i through n, implying that only half the array elements in the 2D array cut are populated. The rest will be populated by the `pair_coeff()` method described next.

### PairMorse::coeff()
This method reads the quantities entered in the LAMMPS input script following the `pair_coeff` command. The following screenshot shows the `coeff()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_3.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.3 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the `coeff()` method

As you can see from the preceding screenshot, *lines 179* to *180* allows 5 or 6 parameters after the `pair_coeff` command in the LAMMPS input script. *Lines 183* to *185* read the atom type pairs, on which this potential applies, using the ``force->bounds()`` method and assigns the range of specified atom types to the variables, `ilo`, `ihi`, `jlo`, and `jhi`.

Lines 187 to 189 store the third, fourth, and fifth parameters as floating-point values of$D_0$ , $\alpha$ , and $r_0$, respectively. *Lines 191* to *192* set the global cutoff as the default cutoff unless a sixth parameter is entered that overwrites the cutoff for the specified atom type pairs. The 2D arrays, `d0`, `alpha`, `r0`, and `cut`, corresponding to these quantities are updated in *lines 194* to *204*, along with changing the `setflag` elements to 1 for these atom type pairs. Only half of these arrays are populated and the rest will be populated in `PairMorse:init_one()`. The count integer is used to keep a tally of the number of atom type pairs for which these parameters are assigned, and *line 206* returns an error if no pair is counted.

### PairMorse::init_one()
This method reads in two atom types as arguments and validates that pair coefficients are defined for them. It also defines the quantity stored in the morse1 array, calculates the offset required to shift the potential value to zero at the cutoff distance, and populates arrays by copying from one set of atom types to its mirror set of atom types.

The following screenshot demonstrates the init_one() function:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_4.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.4 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the init_one() method

As you can see, after *line 216* validates whether the i and j atom types entered as arguments have pair coefficients assigned for their interaction, *line 218* defines a morse1 quantity as $2\alpha D_0$ for convenience of computation that will be employed later.

Lines 220 to 223 calculate the potential at the cutoff, that is,$V_{Morse}(r_{cut})$ , and store it as the offset that can be added to shift the potential function to exactly zero at the cutoff. If the LAMMPS input script does not implement any offset in the potential, the `offset` array is filled with zeros. Then, in *lines 225* to *229*, the arrays that have been partially populated by `PairMorse::coeff()` are fully populated by copying elements for every atom pair (i,j) to its mirror pair(j,i).

### PairMorse::compute()
After having populated all array elements for all atom pairs, the pairwise forces and potential between these atoms are calculated in this method. The following screenshot shows us the `compute()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_5.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.5 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the `compute()` method

As you can see, *lines 79* to *89* loop over all central atoms with the local index, i , and then over all their neighboring atoms with local index, j, as described in *Chapter 4, Accessing Information by Variables, Arrays, and Methods*. *Line 90* checks for special bonds between the `i` and `j` atoms, and the `factor_lj` variable accounts for weights assigned to special bonds in the LAMMPS input script. This check is performed by bitwise comparison using the `sbmask()` function, which will be explained in *Appendix B, Debugging with GDB and Visual Studio Code*. If a special bond is specified, then `factor_lj` is set equal to the weight of the bond; otherwise, it is set equal to 1.

Lines 93 to 95 calculate the displacement vector components $(\Delta {x},\Delta {y},\Delta {z})$ from the j atom to the i atom, and *line 96* calculates the square of the distance between these atoms, $rsq=(\Delta {x})^2+(\Delta {y})^2+(\Delta {z})^2$ . The distance, `r`, itself is not calculated unless necessary to circumvent the computational overhead associated with the square root calculation. On *line 99*, `rsq` is compared with the square of the cutoff between these two atoms to determine whether the atoms are located within the cutoff. If so, `r` is explicitly calculated in *line 100* and the force between the two atoms is calculated next.

As explained in *Chapter 1, MD Theory and Simulation Practices*, the pairwise force depends on the gradient of the pairwise potential, which is $V_{Morse}(r)$, in this case.

First, we calculate the following quantity:

$$\frac{dV_{Morse}}{dr}=-2\alpha D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}]$$

Then, the $(x, y, z)$ force components can be calculated. The (x) force component is given by the following:

$$F_x=\frac{dV}{dr}\times \frac{\Delta{x}}{r}=2\alpha D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}] \frac{\Delta {x}}{r}$$

The $(y)$ force component is calculated by this:

$$F_y=\frac{dV}{dr}\times \frac{\Delta{y}}{r}=2\alpha D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}] \frac{\Delta {y}}{r}$$

The $(z)$ force component is given by the following:

$$F_z=\frac{dV}{dr}\times \frac{\Delta{z}}{r}=2\alpha D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}] \frac{\Delta {z}}{r}$$

In the source code (*Figure 5.5*), *lines 101* to *102* define the variables, $d_r=r-r_0$ and $dexp=e^{-\alpha(r-r_0)}$, and *line 103* defines the `fpair` variable in terms of `factor_lj`, `morse1`, and `dexp`. Upon substituting for morse1 (see the `PairMorse::init_one()` section) in here, `fpair` turns out to be as follows:

$$fpair=factor_lj*2\alpha D_0[e^{-2\alpha (r-r_0)}-e^{-\alpha (r-r_0)}]\frac{1}{r}$$

By multiplying fpair with displacement vector components $(\Delta {x},\Delta {y},\Delta {z})$, the corresponding force components scaled by `factor_lj` are calculated in *lines 105* to *107*. These forces are assigned to the `i` atom in the force array elements, `f[i][0]`, `f[i][1]`, and `f[i][2]` (the `f` array has been defined in *line 66*). The reaction force components acting in opposite directions are assigned to the `j` atom in *lines 108* to *112*, provided that Newton pairs are activated.

This method can also calculate the energy of interaction between atoms with the offset included and with a scaling of `factor_lj` if requested (*lines 114* to *118*).

### PairMorse::single()
The energy of interaction is often required by other classes, such as `computes()`, when running MD simulation. It can be calculated and accessed using the `single()` method, shown as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_6.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.6 - Code snippet from `pair_morse.cpp` showing the `single()` method

As you can see, the input arguments are used to define the same variables, dr, dexp, and `fforce` (which is equivalent to `fpair`) described earlier for the atom `types`, `itype` and `jtype`, entered. Then, in *lines 348* to *349*, the energy is returned as the `phi` variable calculated from the potential function $V_{Morse}(r)$ and its offset and scaling factor, `factor_lj`.

Other pair styles such as the **Lennard-Jones potential** (`pair_lj_cut.cpp`), **Buckingham potential** (`pair_buck.cpp`), and non-long ranged **Coulomb potential** (`pair_coul_cut.cpp`) employ a similar algorithm with different implementations of the potential and force functions. When writing custom pair styles that implement position-dependent potentials, it is recommended to choose one of the existing pair potentials such as `pair_morse.cpp` and modify the relevant sections.

In this section, we learned about the source code responsible for implementing the Morse potential in an MD simulation.

In the next section, we will analyze a table potential that interpolates forces and potentials from a table instead of calculating with a function.

## Reviewing the table potential

In this section, we will learn about the various methods that implement the pair table potential.

The table pair potential described by `pair_table.cpp` and `pair_table.h` reads a file containing potential and force values tabulated for a list of data points corresponding to separations between atoms. When the force or potential at a particular separation is required, one or more of the data points in the file closest to the required separation are used to interpolate the force and potential.

The following LAMMPS inputs script commands are used to implement this pair style:

```
pair_style table TABLE_STYLE N KEYWORD
pair_coeff TYPE1 TYPE2 FILE_NAME VARIABLE CUTOFFs
```

From the preceding code, `TABLE_STYLE` has to be one of the styles mentioned in the LAMMPS manual (`LINEAR`, `LOOKUP`, `SPLINE`, or `BITMAP`), and `N` is the number of data points and KEYWORD is an optional entry for long-range solvers described in the manual.

In the next line, TYPE1 and TYPE2 represent the atom types that interact with this potential, `FILE_NAME` is the name of the file containing the data points, VARIABLE is the keyword in the file used to identify the beginning of the file, and `CUTOFF` has been explained already. The data file format is provided in the LAMMPS manual (https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_table.html), shown as follows:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_7.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.7 - The table potential data file format from the LAMMPS manual

As you can see, the keyword in the data file must be the same as `VARIABLE` from the input script, and the four columns represent the index, separation (`r`), potential, and force used for interpolation.

Having outlined the input script syntax and the data file format, we analyze various methods in `pair_table.cpp`, in the following sections, that process this pair style, starting with parsing of the global coefficients by `PairTable::settings()`.

### PairTable::settings()
This method reads the global coefficients entered after the pair_style table command. The following screenshot shows us the `settings()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_8.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.8 - Code snippet from `pair_table.cpp` showing the `settings()` method

As you can see, this method allows two or more global coefficients (*line 216*). The table style variable, `tabstyle` (*lines 220* to *224*), is assigned an integer to correspond to one of the permitted table styles, which are enumerated in `pair_table.h` (*line 43*):

```
enum{LOOKUP,LINEAR,SPLINE,BITMAP};
```

Line 226 to 227 reads the number of data points (`tablength`) and requires at least two lines of data. *Lines 232* to *241* implement long-range interactions if specified in the LAMMPS input script.

### PairTable::coeff()
This method reads the local coefficients entered for each pair of atom types. The next screenshot exemplifies the `coeff()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_9.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.9 - Code snippet from `pair_table.cpp` showing the `coeff()` method

As you can see, the `coeff()` method allows exactly 4 or 5 parameters (*line 265*) and reads the first two parameters as atom types (*lines 269* to *270*). *Lines 272* to *279* read the filename and the variable name used to identify the table, using the `read_table()` method located inside the same class.

The `read_table()` method takes the filename and the variable name as arguments, opens this file and loops through its lines to locate the variable name and to extract inputs from the parameters line (refer *Figure 5.7*) using the `param_extract()` method. When completed, the r variable and energy and force values are calculated or prepared to be read from the file depending on input parameters.

Afterward (*line 320*), the `coeff()` method calls the `compute_table()` method that calculates the table inner bound (`rinner`), table outer bound (`cut`), the square of the spacing between table data points (`delta`), and the inverse of the spacing (`invdelta`).

Here, `invdelta` is the reciprocal of `delta`, and it is calculated once and stored as a variable to circumvent repeated computation that adds overload associated with the division operation. In the same `compute_table()` method, the force and energy values are stored in 1D arrays, f and e respectively. The value obtained for force is divided by r before storing in the `f` array since it will facilitate calculation of the x, y, z components of the force in the `compute()` method, discussed next.

### PairTable::compute()
This method calculates the separation between an atom and each of its neighbors as explained earlier and stores the square of the separation as rsq. Using this rsq value, the table entry index that gives the `r` value closest to this separation without exceeding it is determined as an integer, `itable`.

The following screenshot shows the part of the code that determines itable:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_10.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.10 - Code snippet from `pair_table.cpp` showing the `compute()` method

As you can see, the force computation depends on the tabstyle variable that indicates one of the `LOOKUP`, `LINEAR`, `SPLINE`, or `BITMAP` styles:

- For the `LOOKUP` style (*line 129*), force is directly read from the `itable` entry of the `f` array, that is, f[`itable`].

- For the `LINEAR` style (*lines 137* to *138*), the fractional distance between the `r` values at the index, `itable` and (`itable`+1), is stored as the fraction variable and is used to linearly interpolate between the `f` values at the same two indices, using the df array that contains the differences between every two consecutive `f` values in the table (see *line 676*).

- For the `SPLINE` style (*lines 147* to *151*), the fractional distance is calculated as for the `LINEAR` style but is fed into a cubic function (*line 149*) to calculate the force.

- For the `BITMAP` style (*lines 153* to *159*), the algorithm described in the manual is performed, using bits to identify the relevant table as `itable` and to interpolate accordingly.

The force determined is stored as `fpair` and multiplied by the displacement vector components $(\Delta {x},\Delta {y},\Delta {z})$ to obtain the force components (*lines 162* to *168*). The corresponding energies are calculated in *lines 171* to *181*:

In this section, we learned about the methods used to implement the pair table potential, namely, the `settings()`, `coeff()`, and `compute()` methods.

In the next section, we analyze the pair style DPD that applies pairwise, drag, and stochastic forces.

## Reviewing the DPD potential

In this section, we look at the DPD potential and its implementation via the `pair_dpd.cpp` and `pair_dpd.h` classes.

**Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)** involves a pairwise conservative force coupled with a dissipative force and a stochastic force acting on two particles that are used to represent larger molecules or clusters. The atomistic details of the molecules or clusters are eliminated or minimized by coarse-graining to facilitate simulation over a longer time scale compared to conventional MD. This technique is particularly useful when simulating fluids, where the particles represent molecules or fluid blocks instead of atoms. The dissipative and stochastic forces can be used to model fluid drag forces and collision forces respectively.

When implementing DPD potential, force from the pairwise potential accounts for part of the pairwise force, whereas the dissipative force needs to be calculated using the relative particle velocities and the random force necessarily has to follow a Gaussian distribution. Altogether, the DPD force acting on an i particle is given by a sum of three pairwiseadditive forces $(F^C,F^D,F^R)$ with a neighboring particle, j, that lies within a fixed cutoff distance $(r_C)$:

$$\overrightarrow{f} = (F_{ij}^C+F_{ij}^D+F_{ij}^R)\hat {r}_{ij}$$

The unit vector, $\hat {r}_{ij}=\frac{\hat {r}_{i}-\hat {r}_{j}}{|\hat {r}_{i}-\hat {r}_{j}|}$ , points from particle j toward particle i. The conservative force $(F_{ij}^C)$ that represents the chemical properties of the particles provides a soft, linear repulsion with a maximum magnitude of A:

$$F_{ij}^C = A(1-\frac{|\hat{r}_{ij}|}{r_c}$$

The dissipative force $(F_{ij}^D)$ that depends on the velocity difference of the two particles, $\hat {v}_{ij}=\hat {v}_{i}-\hat {v}_{j}$, and the drag coefficient,$\gamma$, is given by the following:

$$F_{ij}^{D}=-\gamma _{ij}(1-\frac{|\hat {r}_{ij}|^2}{r_c})(\hat {r}_{ij}\times \hat {v}_{ij})$$

The values of the dissipative force and the random force $(F_{ij}^R)$ are related by the **fluctuation dissipation theorem**, and the statistical values are in accordance with the system temperature (T) distributed over a Gaussian distribution. Using a Gaussian random number, $\alpha$, with a mean of zero and a variance of 1, $F_{ij}^R$ is given by the following equation:

$$F_{ij}^{R}=\alpha \sqrt{2k_BT\gamma _{ij}}(1-\frac{|\hat {r}_{ij}|}{r_c})(\Delta {t})^{-1/2}$$

From the preceding equation, Δ𝑡𝑡 is the timestep and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. In the LAMMPS input script, the following commands implement the DPD potential:

```
pair_style dpd TEMPERATURE GLOBAL_CUTOFF SEED
pair_coeff TYPE1 TYPE2 A GAMMA LOCAL_CUTOFF
```

From the preceding code, the TEMPERATURE parameter is self-explanatory and the A and `GAMMA` parameters represent the quantities A and 𝛾𝛾 , respectively, described earlier. The `GLOBAL_CUTOFF` and `LOCAL_CUTOFF` parameters are the cutoffs used for all atom pairs or specified atom pairs respectively (described in detail in the LAMMPS manual: https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_dpd.html). The `TYPE1` and `TYPE2` parameters specify the pair of atom types that interact via the DPD potential. The SEED parameter is an integer used to generate a Gaussian distribution of random numbers, explained in the `settings()` method.

### PairDPD::settings()
This method reads the global input parameters for the DPD potential and initializes a random number generator. The following screenshot shows the `PairDPD::settings()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_11.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.11 - Code snippet from `pair_dpd.cpp` showing the `settings()` method

As you can see, *lines 193* to *195* read the global parameters, `TEMPERATURE` and `GLOBAL_ CUTOFF`, as floating-point numbers and the `SEED` parameter as an integer. In *line 201*, SEED is then used to create the random class (declared in `pair_dpd.h`) that calls the **Marsaglia** random number generator coded in the `random_mars.cpp` class (the `random_mars.h` header file has been imported in *line 27*).

The **Marsaglia** random number generator takes an integer argument and processes it to generate a sequence of random numbers. `SEED` is added to the processor rank assigned to each core among the multicores used (accessed by `comm->me`) so that a different integer is fed into each core. The random class will be used to generate random numbers in the desired distribution as explained in the next section.

### PairDPD::compute()
This method computes the forces involved in DPD pair interactions. After establishing the neighbors of each i particle, it loops over these j neighbors and computes the three force contributions $(F^C,F^D,F^R)$. The following screenshot shows us the `PairDPD::compute()` method:

<div align=center>
<img src=./ch05/fig5_12.jpg>
</div>

Figure 5.12 - Code snippet from `pair_dpd.cpp` showing the `compute()` method

As you can see, for the neighbors located inside the cutoff, the r separation (*line 114*) and the reciprocal separation, `rinv` (*line 116*), are calculated, followed by the $(x, y, z)$ components of $\vec {v}_{ij}$ (*lines 117* to *120*), where the v array contains the particle velocities declared in *line 75* and the variables (`vxtemp`, `vytemp`, `vztemp`) represent the velocity components of particle, `i` (*lines 95* to *97*).

*Line 120* stores the dot product $(\vec {r}_{ij} \times \vec {v}_{ij})$ as the variable, `dot`, which needs to be divided by the r separation to obtain the quantity $(\vec {r}_{ij} \times \vec {v}_{ij})$as required in $F^D$. *Line 121* defines a variable, `wd`, to use as a shorthand notation for the quantity $1-\frac{|\vec {r}_{ij}|}{r_c}$. The randnum variable is defined in *line 122* to represent $\alpha$ by storing a random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution of mean zero and variance 1 using the `random->gaussian()` method (defined in `random_mars.cpp).

Having defined the variables, $F^C$ is computed in *line 128* and stored as the variable, `fpair`. In *line 129*, the rinv quantity is incorporated to divide dot by r while computing $F^D$ , and the result is tallied to `fpair`. Before calculating $F^R$, the 2D array, sigma, is defined in *line 273* inside PairDPD::init_one() to store the quantity, $\sqrt {2k_BT\gamma _{ij}}$:

```
sigma[i][j] = sqrt(2.0*force->boltz*temperature*gamma[i][j]);
```
Also, the dtinvsqrt variable is defined on *line 81* to store the quantity, $(\Delta {t})^(-\frac{1}{2})$:

```
double dtinvsqrt = 1.0/sqrt(update->dt);
```

On *line 130*, these quantities are multiplied with randnum and wd to obtain 𝐹𝐹𝑅𝑅 and the result is tallied to fpair. Finally, on *line 131*, the `fpair` variable containing contributions from $F^C$ , $F^D$, and $F^R$ is scaled by the `factor_dpd` quantity to account for any special bonds (*line 104*) and multiplied by rinv to facilitate $(x, y, z)$ force component calculations. At this stage, `fpair` effectively equals the following:

$$fpari=factor_dpd*(F_{ij}^C+F_{ij}^D+F_{ij}^R)\frac{1}{r_{ij}}$$

The $(x, y, z)$ components of `fpair` are assigned to the appropriate array elements of the force array, f, in *lines 133* to *139* (see *Figure 5.12*).

The potential $V_{DPD}(r)$ of a DPD potential is calculated only from the conservative force, $F^C$ :

$$V_{DPD}(r)=-\int _{0}^{r} {F^C(r)\ dr}=-\int _{0}^{r} {A(1-\frac{r}{r_c})\ dr}=\frac{1}{2}Ar_c(1-\frac{r}{r_c})^2$$

This potential is computed in *lines 142* to *148* and in the `PairDPD::single()` method and is scaled to accommodate special bonds if required.

In this section, we learned the mechanism behind the DPD pair potential, including the force and potential calculations performed by the `compute()` method.

## Summary

In this chapter, some of the existing LAMMPS pair styles have been analyzed to demonstrate the roles played by various methods in performing the required calculations and exchanging information. Other variants of potentials implemented in LAMMPS include the many-body (that is, non-pairwise) **Stillinger-Weber (SW)** potential and the Pair List option that assigns pair coefficients to individual atom pairs instead of atom type pairs.

Position-dependent potentials are implemented using a functional form in the `compute()` method or can be implemented in a tabulated form read by the pair style. Non-conservative forces can also be implemented alongside by defining the appropriate force functions.

You can now use the lessons and skills learned from this chapter to modify the appropriate methods in a pair potential to customize it per your simulation requirements.

In the next chapter, we will analyze selected compute styles to illustrate the inner mechanism of the code as it has been done in this chapter.
